let addReadmeText = """### AddReadme

The AddReadme editor adds a GitHub-like `README.md` to a project.

#### Prerequisites

Before running this editor, you must have the following prerequisites
satisfied.

*   A source code repository

#### Parameters

To run this editor, you must supply the following parameters.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
`project_name` | Yes | | A valid GitHub repository name.
`description` | No | My new project | A brief description of the project between 1 and 100 characters.

[semver]: http://semver.org

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
\$ cd to/the/repo
\$ rug edit atomist-rugs:rug-archive:AddReadme \
    project_name=fun-project \
    description='A project that needs a README'
```

This will create a simple `README.md` file in the top-level directory
of the source code repository.  If you are happy with the change,
commit the changes.
